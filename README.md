# How Are Bezier Curves Made? [Accepted]

This is an interactive scene that shows how Bezier curver are made in an interactive and fun way. The user will be able to interact with the curves point to make new curves and see in real time how it is being made. I also decided to add storytelling to make the person more engaged and interested in finishing the scene.
